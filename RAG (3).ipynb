The \\nSMCS has a qualiﬁed faculty comprising of experienced practitioners and researchers that enrich teaching, provide business consultancies, support startups, and prepare students \\nfor higher education and industry. The school has state-of-the-art facilities focusing on undergraduate and graduate education. The research labs for Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Web \\nScience, Big Data and Telecommunications allow computer science students to delve deep into the technological realm. In contrast, the mathematics programs offer a thorough \\nbackground in pure and applied mathematics ranging from high-performance computing to commutative algebra.School of Mathematics and Computer Science (SMCS)\\nI am greatly honored to share the Dean’s message with my faculty members who have contributed with their hard work, vision, and leadership, to make \\nthis school one of the best science schools in the country.\\nThe history of science programs in IBA dates to 1983 when it started offering a diploma program in Computer Science to overcome the shortage of \\ninformation and system analysts in the country. Since then, the venture has matured and now offers BS, MS, and PhD programs in Mathematics and \\nComputer Science. We have established research labs for Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Web Science, Big Data, and Telecommunication, supporting the MS and \\nPhD programs in the diverse domains of Computer Science. Likewise, the MS and PhD programs in Mathematics aim to provide a thorough background \\nin theory, quantitative methods, and applications commensurate with international standards, offering the opportunity of highly specialized training in \\nselected areas of pure and applied mathematics.\\nAs IBA moves into the new system of schools, the newly established SMCS must continue to incubate and stay poised toward cutting-edge research and \\ndevelopment in science and technology. In the coming years, we plan to enhance our academic programs by investing in our star faculty, establishing \\nstrong research and industrial ties across the globe, and bringing new specializations in Mathematics, Computer Science and allied ﬁelds. Our mission is \\nto impart quality education to students selected purely on merit, irrespective of ethnicity, gender, religion or ﬁnancial means.\\nThe foremost aim of SMCS will be to establish academic linkages with leading science schools of the world so that we can enhance our teaching and research. This would assist towards \\ninnovations through joint research projects, focused on bringing new knowledge to the classrooms, thereby enriching academic transactions at IBA. The second aim is to offer more \\nstreams of specializations. We have introduced an MS program in Data Science and also plan to offer more programs in Mathematics and Computer Science. This will help diversify our \\nportfolio to attract brilliant students, as well as high-caliber researchers and faculty. We envisage more productive and\\nsociety-driven research in the new school. A new BS program in Mathematics is also a step in this direction.\\nWith the IBA’s mission to undertake consultancy and applied research to enrich teaching and inﬂuence thinking on important issues of business and public policy, we believe that \\nSMCS will play a pivotal role to bring a signiﬁcant contribution to the global challenges that science and technology can solve.\\nDr. Shakeel Ahmed KhojaDean’s Message\\nDepartment of Computer Science\\nThe Department of Computer Science is one of the two departments at the School of Mathematics and Computer \\nScience (SMCS), the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) Karachi.

The standard of review required is \\nthat the original hearing authority’s decision was clearly erroneous and cannot reasonably \\nbe supported by the evidence; necessitating ‘deference’ to be given to the original decision.\\nl Harshness of the penalty imposed by the DC sufficient to show an abuse of discretion. The \\nstandard of review required is failure to exercise reasonable judgment under the \\ncircumstances, necessitating deference to be given to the original decision.\\nl Emergence of new evidence that was not reasonably available for presentation to the DC \\nwhich may reasonably be expected to affect the recommendation reached by the DC.  The \\nstandard of review required is:\\n\\ts  Appellant to demonstrate that evidence was not reasonably available at the time, and;\\n\\ts  That the new evidence can be reasonably expected to affect the original body’s decision; \\nnecessitating the case be remanded to the DC for recording new evidence and \\nreconsideration of the decision.\\nl Step 2\\n The Chairman DC will be provided a copy of the student’s written appeal and be asked by \\nthe appellate body to provide the record/case file.\\nl Step 3\\n The concerned parties shall be informed by the Secretary SCISC about the date, time, and \\nplace of hearing of the Appeal and forward necessary materials to Appellate Committee \\nmembers and the Appellant.
