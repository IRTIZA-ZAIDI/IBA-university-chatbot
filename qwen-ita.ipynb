As you know, I am currently working\non my project report for my degree program in FCS at IBA University.

The topic requires extensive research and analysis, which has\nbeen taking up a significant portion of my schedule. As a result, I would like\nto request an extension on the deadline for the project report submission.  I\nunderstand that our academic calendars can be quite demanding, and I apologize\nfor any inconvenience this may cause. However, I assure you that I will make\nsure to complete the analysis section as soon as possible and submit my work\nbefore the deadline.  Thank you for considering my request.
