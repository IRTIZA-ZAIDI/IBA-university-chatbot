Q\\n\\nI have qualified for admission in an IBA program by clearing all the tests and interviews, but don’t have any funds to support tuition fees. Will IBA help me by giving me scholarships or freeships? A. The IBA offers financial assistance to deserving students in the form of scholarships and loans.

In the academic session 2008-09, as many as 280 students amounting to Rs. 31.0 million received scholarships. For further details and downloading financial aid application program, visit Financial Assistance. Note: Financial assistance is at present only reserved for full time morning program students.

Q\\n\\nI have qualified for admission in an IBA program by clearing all the tests and interviews, but don’t have any funds to support tuition fees. Will IBA help me by giving me scholarships or freeships? A. The IBA offers financial assistance to deserving students in the form of scholarships and loans.

In the academic session 2008-09, as many as 280 students amounting to Rs. 31.0 million received scholarships. For further details and downloading financial aid application program, visit Financial Assistance. Note: Financial assistance is at present only reserved for full time morning program students.
